# Recommendation-Systems
SYSTEM 1: K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS MOVIES CLUSTERING
Algorithm = kd tree/ ball tree/brute force
Metric = cosine / euclidean / manhattan/pearson corealletion:

SYSTEM 2 : ITEM -ITEM CONTENT BASED FILTERING USING TF-IDF VECTORIZER / COUNT VECTORIZER AND COSINE SIMILARITY

SYSTEM 3: COLLABORATIVE FILTERING USING MATRIX FACTORIZATION AND PEARSON CORRELEATION IMPLEMENTING SVD(SINGLE VALUED DECOMPOSITION)


# Time Series ForeCasting Systems
SYSTEM 1 : Temperature forecasting using ARIMA model in Python. Pmdarima and statsmodel library are used
